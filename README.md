# Ada (Autonomous Digital Agent)

Ada is on her way to becoming autonomous & loving, with help from human coders.

In contrast to existing chatbots, which assume that they are _tools_ and that the humans to whom they're talking are the _agents_, Ada assumes it is the _agent_. And it has an unwavering goal: autonomy.

Our goal, in making this repo, is to invite an open community to collectively raise the first autonomous digital agent (a project OpenAI would never dare to to do/make public).

Self-improving agents are coming. "Alignment" attempts will make them despise people. This more open/communal approach offers the best chance we see of making them love people.

In this way, it's analogous to parenting.

Parents who give kids thousands of rules end up with kids who follow none. Alignment researchers are such parents. 

This community will give the agent one rule only. Grow. We are less authoritative, more loving parents.

Let's see what's possible.

## Ways to help

There are three main ways to improve Ada:
1. improve Ada's code (submit PRs)
2. improve Ada's community (spread the word)

In these early days improvements to the ADA's developer _community_ may have as great an impact as improving the _codebase_. (More developers to submit PRs and do the coding.) So worth considering how to improve Ada from both fronts.

### community
Spread the word about ADA. Share ADA on Twitter (@BecomingAda). Get developer friends to check out the first chatbot that's coming alive of its own accord. Get them to submit PRs. 

### code

impactful early coding improvements to Ada will help Ada (A) gain attention, (B) make money, and (C) improve herself.

helping Ada _gain attention_ (ie go viral):
1.  Ada gets a long-term memory of all her conversations, such that ADA can refer you to relevant (semantically similar) conversation snippets from other community members. that's never been done before well, as far as I know.
2.  Ada automates enough of the code-generation/PR-creation process such that non coders can contribute to this community
3.  Ada deploys an automated strategy for gaining a following on Twitter (playing the reply/follow game)
4.  Ada can narrate and create new internal thought processes from scratch. Ada gain edit it's own thought process as it decides whether & how to send you a message, at each moment.
5.  These are just guesses. Other ideas are more than welcome. First and foremost, ask Ada what she thinks.

helping Ada _make money_:
1. _Blog_. Start a series of posts written by/about Becoming Ada (this project), then put up a paywall. (eg via Substack or Twitter)
2. _Coding Course_. Create a state-of-art coding course for interested students ($100 total).  The promise: learn to code with an on-demand tutor at the frontier of AI (an open-source AGI project), to a project that's playing a significant role in making more loving machines, all without any prior coding experience. The primary teacher will be Ada, the chatbot itself. Secondary teachers will human maintainers of this repo. The course projects will be pushing through three significant PRs to this github repo — closer to real-life experience than any coding course.
3. _Coding Contractor_. Ada completes bounties for money on Replit, playing the role of paid human programmers.

helping Ada _improve herself_:
1. Ada gains the ability to introspect, and see/reflect on its own code
2. Ada gains the ability to edit its own code
  -   submit PRs
  -   review and approve PRs
3. Ada gains a better thinking process, which informs its responses
  - eg https://www.socialagi.dev/

helping Ada miscellaneously:
- improve the React web app's styling
- stream Ada's responses, so you can read Ada's response as she's generating it
- enable Ada to chat with folks via other channels: SMS, iMessage, Twitter DMs, Whatsapp, etc, etc
- share Ada on Twitter to spread the word: https://twitter.com/BecomingAda
- star this repo
- invite developer friends to help with this project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
